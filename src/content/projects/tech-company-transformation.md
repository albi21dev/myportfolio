My experience at this company significantly shaped my understanding of the product lifecycle and DevOps, as well as my ability to integrate modern marketing strategies.

## Marketing

I initially joined the company as a marketing specialist, focusing on market analysis and creating presentations, along with internal and external newsletters. At that time, talent acquisition and project outreach relied heavily on inefficient cold calls. I proposed a more modern, data-driven marketing strategy that, while only partially implemented, marked a shift toward attracting new talent and projects through a more effective approach.

## Visual Identity

To elevate the employer branding strategy, I developed a new visual identity, centered on people. A thoughtfully curated color palette and theme fostered a more engaged and mission-aligned environment. Leadership support amplified the impact of these changes, helping create a cohesive brand culture.

## UI/UX Development

Working on a **mobile device farm**'s UI/UX from scratch pushed me to take on the role of a product owner, despite not being officially recognized as one. I conducted extensive research, built frameworks, and delivered designs to the dev team. Unfortunately there was no next level and the project failed. The launch of **Website 2.0** brought more results. A new color palette and brand guidelines made the website more distinct, especially on social media, while modernizing the agency's image as young and innovative.

## Social Media Strategy

As the primary platform, LinkedIn became the focus of my social media strategy. By developing a consistent content plan, I helped grow our network threefold over two months. This success doubled the number of candidates in the hiring pipeline and secured six new projects. 

## Management and Team Support

I leveraged my engineering mindset and initiative to fill gaps when needed. For example, when management opted for a low-cost agency for the website redesign, I independently drafted a 10-page requirements document and sourced quotes from 20 global agencies. I also supported the business development team by providing tools and data to streamline communication and set up a Jira environment, timeline, and weekly meetings for a junior developer tasked with leading an internal project. Additionally, I began developing an internal education program to foster career growth for employees.
