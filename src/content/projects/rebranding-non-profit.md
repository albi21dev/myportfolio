It all started during one of their events, where I witnessed a magnificent live pattern being drawn on their stairs by the kids. Inspired, I grabbed my camera and vectorized the artwork. 

## Visual Branding

The color palette was thoughtfully selected to reflect their green goals, starting from the original logos and adding a "Very pale orange" for consistency and enhanced accessibility. The fonts **Questrial** and **Poppins** were the perfect pair to underline simplicity and joy. The other logos were sending mixed signals, so I refreshed them to be consistent with the main logo.

## WordPress Theme and Development

I chose the WordPress theme **Neve** for its clean and modern design. It did present some bugs, but nothing I couldn't handle. This experience will be useful for future projects. My mantra is **audience first, mobile second**. In our initial meeting, I always emphasize the importance of understanding the target audience. For [scartiamo.com](https://scartiamo.com/), I created a site-map designed to attract volunteers and business angels. While the current stock photos don't fully capture the brand's essence, I plan to return to Italy to shoot the right media.

## SEO and Future Collaborations

SEO in the non-profit field is crucial. Tools like Answer The Public or Google's Keyword Planner are perfect for refining texts and metadata. WordPress plugins also come in handy for SEO optimization. Moving forward, I will collaborate with Scartiamo.com to build a consistent and sustainable social media strategy. Nothing fancy, but effective.
