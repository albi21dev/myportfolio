Orizzonti is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting communities through social initiatives. My role was to create visually compelling, easy-to-use digital materials that enabled the team to independently engage potential donors and maximize their outreach.

## Briefing and Brainstorming
I led every meeting to develop an efficient strategy, analyzing the community’s history and understanding the key stakeholders involved. The audience included companies, and the messaging needed to be clear, concise, and actionable to drive donations effectively.

## User-Friendly Environment
I built the presentation in **Canva** to allow staff to make updates independently, focusing my efforts on polished graphics and pragmatic, concise copy. Canva provided the perfect balance between aesthetic quality and the technical skills of the team.

## Social Campaign
Using Canva for video creation, I set up a brand awareness campaign designed to reach a wider social audience than the organization could achieve alone. I also advised on workflow, targeting, and budget allocation to maximize the campaign’s impact.
