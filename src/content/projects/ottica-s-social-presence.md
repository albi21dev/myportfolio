From a cold call sparked by simple e-commerce prospecting to a genuine, equal-footed collaboration. While my initial plan was to boost online sales, the real goal on the table became something more human: bringing more people into the store, all with a minimal budget to test my skills.

## Trusted partnership in 6 month
Through my plan, [Ottica Punto di vista](https://www.instagram.com/otticapuntodivista.cesena/) doubled its followers in six months. The trust I earned grew to the point where the owner began asking for advice on his e-commerce and commissioning me for tailored tweaks and on-the-spot consulting.

## Creative Direction
I scheduled bi-monthly **photoshoots** to keep the brand’s feed visually sharp and artistically consistent. Each session involved careful set planning and lighting design, followed by post-production in Lightroom to refine tones and highlight the brand’s unique identity. This recurring process helped maintain a cohesive and recognizable style over time.

## Video Campaign
I personally crafted the video concept, shooting, and editing, challenging myself with a small obstacle along the way. To push my skills further, I stepped beyond Premiere and explored DaVinci, broadening my knowledge and creative toolkit.
