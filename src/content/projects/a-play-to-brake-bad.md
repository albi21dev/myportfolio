Sintucci Castaldi is a young theatre company from Cesena, composed of emerging actors taking their first steps into the spotlight. With their debut original play, they embraced the challenge of bringing fresh voices and raw creativity to the stage.

## Directing through the Lens  
As photographer, my Canon 6D became more than just a tool — it allowed me to guide actors and capture powerful stories in a single frame. Every shot was built with intention, balancing direction and spontaneity to let authentic performances shine.  

## The Challenge  
The greatest challenge didn’t come during the play itself, but from the client’s request: to give the scene an adult, cinematic atmosphere. In post-production with **Lightroom**, I imposed a strong artistic vision, heavily inspired by **Michael Slovis**, the cinematographer of *Breaking Bad*. His influence guided my color grading and visual storytelling choices.

## Cinematic Result  
The outcome is a series of photographs with a bold, cinematic identity — where each frame resonates like a scene from a film, evoking the same tension, grit, and artistry that made *Breaking Bad* unforgettable.
