**The brainchild of my brand and website** stems from my engineering mindset, where precision meets creativity. I wanted to portray my artistic side with a clear and effective visual identity. To push my limits, I chose **Astro** as my framework for two reasons: one, to keep leveling up my skills, and two, to stay ahead of the curve.

**Astro** is the cool kid in the web development playground, known for its unique features that make building content-rich websites a breeze. One standout feature is Astro's support for server-side rendering, which is as traditional as grandma's recipes but without the need to learn a new language.

## My Workflow

### Logo, Custom Font, and Visual Identity

I kicked things off with a sans-serif typeface that’s heavy on the eyes and high on the x-height, as if each letter was built from rounded rectangles. This typeface became the backbone of my visual identity, ensuring consistency and geometric harmony. I aimed for a look that’s solid yet modern and fresh—nothing too fancy or minimalistic. The logo needed to scream "digital world" and nod to the Figma cursor.

The color palette was a thoughtful blend of **Amber yellow** for innovation and **Cerise pink** for trust. I designed with inclusion in mind; these colors only appear in the logo and are distinct enough to be friendly to everyone, even those with color blindness.

### UI/UX on Figma for the Homepage

My motto? **Audience first, mobile second, and trends are just fancy fads**. I gathered content using ChatGPT and MidJourney, ensuring everything resonated with my vision and user expectations.

### Development Using Visual Studio Code and GitHub

To save on directory costs, I hosted my project on GitHub. This development phase was a wild ride, considering I only started coding in January 2024. Despite the challenge, I've loved every minute of it!

## S(E)o, What’s Next?

With a solid plan, killer design, and the powerful Astro framework, my brand is ready to take on the digital world. Slowly I will optimize every page for Search Engines using some usefull tools like Google Trends, Analytics, Search Console, Keywords Planner and Semrush. But for my purposes this step can wait few more weeks.
